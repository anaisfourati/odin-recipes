            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Chocolate Mousse may well be the ultimate chocolate fix! Rich and creamy, yet light and fluffy, one pot is satisfying but always leaves me wanting more……</p>
            <p>This is a classic chocolate mousse <strong>made the proper French way</strong>, as served in fine dining restaurants. Less cream, more chocolate, a more intense chocolate flavour and a beautiful creamy mouth feel.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>125g dark cooking chocolate</li>
                <li>10g unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1/2 cup cream</li>
                <li>3 tbsp caster sugar</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>For reliable results, work at a steady pace so your whipped egg whites and cream do not get too warm!</li>
                <li><strong>Separate eggs and yolks</strong>while eggs are cold. Place whites in a large bowl and yolks in a small bowl. Leave whites while you prepare other ingredients. (Note 4)</li>
                <li>Yolks: Whisk yolks until uniform.</li>
                <li>Melt chocolate and butter: Break chocolate into pieces and place in a microwave-proof bowl with the butter. Melt in the microwave in 30 second bursts, stirring in between, until smooth. (Stir in optional flavourings at this point, but read Note 6 first). Set aside to cool slightly while you proceed with other steps.</li>
                <li>Whip cream: Beat cream until stiff peaks form, being careful not to over-whip (see video).</li>
                <li>Whip whites: Add sugar. Beat whites until firm peaks form (see video, Note 5)</li>
            </ol>
